I use peanut butter on my bread
I have fried rice cooked with soy sauce
I like having meatballs made from ground beef
I like grilled chicken accompanied with cilantro, bell pepper, and potato
Salads and bowls are a good combination for me
I add garlic paste to most of my meals to improve the taste
Yogurt is my go to breakfast
I usually have mushrooms with pasta
Starting my day with coffee makes it 10 times better
Cereals is my lazy dinner
